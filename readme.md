please run   
docker-compose up  
before starting the application

data is stored locally for convenience in db-data folder
configuration (to use local data) can be changed in app.config, just set ResetDatabase to false to use existing data

reports will be saved to ...\FundaTestTask\FundaTestTask.ConsoleClient\bin\Debug\net8.0

AI note: I have Copilot enabled, but its suggestions are not really used here
